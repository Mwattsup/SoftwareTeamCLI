# SoftwareTeamCLI

SoftwareTeamCLI is a cli that takes the information you give it about employees and makes them a team displaying their role and the basic info you need to know about them in one single html page.

## How to Use

Run the index.js file in node and answer the prompted questions. This will create a PDF file in the output directory that you can then open and view the basic information needed for the employees on the software team.

### Challenges

One major thing that set me back with this homework was trying to us templates to make the html page. I'm pretty sure I still didn't really use the templates as inteded because I just couldnt figure it out. 

I was also going to add in checks to make sure the input value that was given would be the correct inouts or ask the question again but I ran out of time after trying for so long to figure out the html templates and trying to combine the files somehow.
